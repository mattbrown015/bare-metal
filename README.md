# bare-metal

Attempt to create a *bare metal* STM32L4 application.

I've done quite a lot of work with Mbed OS and wanted to try my hand at going in at a lower level.

I'm not sure it is really *bare metal*, I'm going to use the HAL and will probably end up with the Standard Library.

In an attempt to understand working with the STM32L4, Cortex-M4 and ARM GCC I've stripped out loads of cruft from the examples I've found. This probably means nothing is really correct and I'll end up putting everything back!
